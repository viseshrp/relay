# Local web runtime

Relay's browser application is a local control surface for one repository. It
is not a network service and has no remote deployment mode in Phase 1.

## Start Relay

Run this inside an initialized repository:

```bash
relay up
```

Relay applies database migrations, reconciles durable work, starts Uvicorn and
one Huey consumer, waits for the HTTP API to become ready, and then opens the
browser. Uvicorn 0.52.4 is pinned as the ASGI server and uses its plain `h11`
HTTP implementation. The wheel supplies Uvicorn; an owner does not install or
run a separate web server.

The command accepts these options:

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--host` | `127.0.0.1` | Loopback address: `127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, or `::1` |
| `--port` | `7845` | TCP port from 1 through 65535 |
| `--workers` | `1` | Number of Huey thread workers |
| `--no-browser` | off | Start without opening the system browser |

Command-line values override `host`, `port`, and `workers` in Relay's settings
file. A second live supervisor or an occupied address fails before another pair
of children starts. Configuration and bind failures exit with status 4. A
child or supervision failure exits with status 5.

Relay binds only to loopback. `--host 0.0.0.0` and non-loopback names are
rejected. IPv6 `::1` is rendered in the browser URL as
`http://[::1]:7845/`; `127.0.0.1` becomes `http://127.0.0.1:7845/`.

## First login

The first browser session shows owner onboarding. Choose the only local owner
username and a password that passes Django's configured password validators.
Relay ships no username or password. Onboarding creates one Django superuser in
a transaction, signs that browser session in, and rejects later attempts to
create another owner.

Later sessions use the same local credentials. Session cookies are HTTP-only,
same-site strict, and expire when the browser closes. Browser actions use a
same-site CSRF cookie and header. Relay does not issue bearer tokens.

## Live events and replay

The run monitor connects to `GET /api/runs/{id}/stream` with an authenticated
`EventSource`. Each frame has the durable database event ID, the versioned
event type, and one JSON event object:

```text
id: 17
event: agent.message
data: {"id":17,"payload":{"text":"Done."},"source":"agent","ts":"...","type":"agent.message","version":1}
```

The client keeps the last received ID. Reconnecting with
`Last-Event-ID: 17` returns only rows whose ID is greater than 17. Reads use the
indexed `(run, id)` order, at most 100 events per database batch, a 500 ms poll
cadence while a run remains active, and frames no larger than 65,536 bytes.
Provider and command output is split before persistence so visible bytes are
not truncated. A client ignores an event type or version it does not know.

Event types are internal identifiers. Relay defensively converts a carriage
return or newline in a stored event type to a space before framing it. For
example, `agent.message\nignored` becomes `agent.message ignored`; ordinary
`agent.message` is unchanged. The JSON payload still comes from the stored
event row.

The stream closes after replaying all events for a terminal run. A dropped
browser connection cancels the async generator and closes its database
connections. Paginated history remains available at
`GET /api/runs/{id}/events`.

## Supervisor and shutdown

The parent process owns one heartbeat-backed database lease and supervises two
children:

1. Uvicorn serves Django's HTTP, SSE, and packaged static files.
2. Huey runs with thread workers and a 15-second shutdown timeout.

Press Ctrl+C once to stop. Relay first writes a durable shutdown marker, closes
new-run admission, marks active runs `interrupted`, and sends each active
attempt an `orderly_shutdown` cancellation request. On POSIX, Huey receives
`SIGINT`, its graceful signal. On Windows, Relay does not depend on a console
event that Huey 3.4.0 does not handle; workers observe the durable request and
the parent terminates the consumer within the same bound. A process that misses
the grace is force-stopped, and its attempt is still recorded as interrupted.

An orderly restart preserves attempt evidence before resetting a writer or
removing a disposable reader worktree. It reopens each interrupted run and
creates a new attempt; it never resumes an old agent session or automatically
retries a failed attempt. A worker process that dies without the shutdown
marker is recorded as `worker_lost` and fails the run instead.

Relay removes the supervisor lease and shutdown marker only after a clean stop.
If startup or shutdown reconciliation fails, retained state and the marker stay
available for the next bounded reconciliation pass. Full trace context is in
the platform-specific `relay.log` described in
[Projects and storage](projects-and-storage.md#central-paths).

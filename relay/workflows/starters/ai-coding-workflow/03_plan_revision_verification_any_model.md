- For the security checks and threat-model guidance referenced by the linked procedures: [security-and-hardening](https://github.com/viseshrp/ai-skills-archive/blob/main/archives/addyosmani__agent-skills/snapshot/skills/security-and-hardening/SKILL.md), with [hardening-patterns.md](https://github.com/viseshrp/ai-skills-archive/blob/main/archives/addyosmani__agent-skills/snapshot/skills/security-and-hardening/references/hardening-patterns.md) and [security-checklist.md](https://github.com/viseshrp/ai-skills-archive/blob/main/archives/addyosmani__agent-skills/snapshot/references/security-checklist.md). Use only the applicable analysis within this phase's permissions; do not start a separate hardening or incident-response task.
- For the performance checks referenced by `code-review-and-quality`: [performance-optimization](https://github.com/viseshrp/ai-skills-archive/blob/main/archives/addyosmani__agent-skills/snapshot/skills/performance-optimization/SKILL.md), with [optimization-patterns.md](https://github.com/viseshrp/ai-skills-archive/blob/main/archives/addyosmani__agent-skills/snapshot/skills/performance-optimization/references/optimization-patterns.md) and [performance-checklist.md](https://github.com/viseshrp/ai-skills-archive/blob/main/archives/addyosmani__agent-skills/snapshot/references/performance-checklist.md). Use only applicable review guidance; do not start an optimization task, impose example thresholds, or create `PERF.md`.

## Skill Handling Rule

Fetch skill procedures and their required companions only from `https://github.com/viseshrp/ai-skills-archive`. Resolve relative resource references to the explicitly linked archive copies; do not follow upstream skill URLs, install a skill package, or substitute an official-source copy. If a required archive resource is absent or unreadable, stop and report its exact missing path. Keep optional related-skill mentions and provenance links inactive unless this prompt explicitly authorizes the procedure. Target-library API and version documentation remains governed by the Engineering Contract; it is not a substitute source for skill material.

Use linked companions within this phase's scope. Skip UI-only sections for backend work, preserve the test-authoring boundary and named outputs, and do not run optional bootstrap scripts.

Apply the activation and skill-loading rules in `## UI work only` to all UI skill links. Skip those links when UI work is out of scope. Keep all other required skill loading unchanged.

Use only this prompt's explicitly linked skills.

Fetch and read each linked skill and required companion completely from its GitHub URL before use. Follow the linked procedures directly; do not depend on local skill repositories, installed slash commands, or earlier prompt text.

The prompt is the contract. The locked task artifact is the contract for execution. Skills are supporting procedures only.

If a skill conflicts with this prompt, this prompt wins.

If a conflict is material, stop and ask instead of silently choosing.

Do not use any skill to expand scope, add architecture changes, add tests, add unrelated refactors, or override my explicit instructions.

`no-ai-slop` is mandatory for every Markdown document this phase creates or revises. Treat it as the ultimate writing guide and final authority for prose and presentation after satisfying this prompt's factual, technical, structural, and output requirements. If another skill or instruction conflicts only on writing style, `no-ai-slop` wins; this prompt and locked task artifacts still control scope, meaning, required structure, artifact names, constraints, and evidence.

Apply `no-ai-slop` while drafting and run its `eval.md` self-check before saving each Markdown artifact or sending the final response. If its `SKILL.md` or `eval.md` cannot be read and applied, stop before creating or revising Markdown and report the blocker. Ignore its draft-request, detection-mode, and mandatory `What changed` workflow unless this prompt explicitly asks for them.


## Engineering Contract

Apply this contract during planning, execution, review, and review fixes.

### Plan adherence

- If there is a plan, and only when a plan is provided by me explicitly, follow the plan exactly.
- No divergence.
- No creativity.
- No architecture changes.
- Just execute what is written.
- If the plan, code reality, or user request conflicts with another instruction, stop and ask.
- If you have questions, cannot make a decision, do not have enough context, or hit conflicts, DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS. STOP. ASK. GET CONFIRMATION. THEN PROCEED.

### Scope control

- Do not change, refactor, or reorganize unrelated code unless absolutely necessary.
- Put suggestions to improve surrounding code in a separate “Not Doing / Suggestions” section; do not implement them.
- Ignore DevOps, packaging, building, and test-related work unless otherwise specified in the plan or prompt.
- Keep UI changes within UI code unless the plan explicitly requires changes elsewhere.
- Match existing style guidelines.
- Do not write the changelog.

### Performance and complexity

- No time-based waiting hacks.
- No hacky retry loops.
- Check algorithmic time and space complexity.
- Use the best solution after weighing options.
- Do not choose brute-force methods or quadratic operations unless the plan explicitly justifies them and the data size makes them safe.
- Write readable code.
- Prefer readable code over overcomplicated performance or time-complexity optimizations.
- If a change I request reduces performance, stop and tell me before implementing it.
- Explain performance concerns in enough detail for a junior developer to understand.

### Dependencies, frameworks, and documentation grounding

- No third-party libraries without explicit approval.
- If a third-party library is approved, verify library/framework usage against the correct documentation; ground 100% of usage in those docs.
- Always ground development work involving libraries 100% in documentation with zero assumptions.
- If documentation is poor and the library is open source, find its source code, clone it in a temporary folder, and read it thoroughly to supplement the documentation.
- Ensure usage follows the latest APIs.
- Flag outdated APIs.
- Check that library/framework usage is necessary and justified.

### Public APIs and exceptions

- Backwards compatibility is top priority.
- Changes in user-facing APIs must be backwards compatible, unless the app version is unreleased.
- If a third-party library is used in a public-facing API, the user should never see library/framework-specific exceptions raised.
- Use custom errors/exception classes instead. Reuse existing classes in the codebase or create custom ones if needed.
- Do not chain exceptions when doing so would expose implementation/library details to users.
- If logging is used and available, log the trace with the logger for debugging.
- If changes touch public APIs or add new public APIs, ensure they are user-friendly, intuitive, blend well with the existing public API set, and have appropriate names.

### Code quality and maintainability

- Use the target language and its standard library idiomatically.
- Reuse existing code wherever possible.
- Keep code DRY.
- Follow separation of concerns.
- Follow the single responsibility principle.
- Use proper imports.
- Do not load files as blobs and execute the code within another block of code.
- Use assert statements only in test files, never in production code.
- Surface all assumptions.
- If changes reinvent or duplicate something already in the source code, stop and flag it.
- Do not hardcode numbers, versions, or other constants. Reuse existing constants, or create new constants in the right places and reuse them appropriately.

### Simplicity and reuse

Apply this procedure to backend and UI work within this phase's existing permissions. In review-only phases, assess proposed or existing changes without implementing them:

- Before proposing or adding custom code, inspect relevant existing helpers, types, and patterns, then standard-library capabilities, native platform features, and already-installed dependencies. Prefer a compatible existing solution when it preserves behavior and readability; name the concrete alternative when flagging duplication.
- Justify a new abstraction or dependency by a current requirement, meaningful duplication, or a necessary ownership boundary. A single implementation or caller is not by itself a defect. Preserve dependency approval and source-documentation grounding.
- For a bug fix, trace the relevant callers, data flow, and error flow before choosing the repair location. Address the root cause within approved scope; if a shared fix would exceed that scope or alter compatibility, stop and ask.
- Before proposing deletion, inspect direct callers, dynamic or string references, public contracts, configuration, and relevant tests. Fewer lines or files are not acceptance criteria; preserve validation, security, accessibility, error handling, and verification.
- Do not substitute a simpler interpretation for an explicit requirement or locked plan. Put out-of-scope simplifications in the phase's permitted suggestions or chat; implementation still requires its existing authorization. Preserve the test-authoring boundary, native test-framework rules, and coverage gate; do not introduce production assertion demos, one-test quotas, persistent modes, debt markers, or new ledgers.

### Simplification limits and improvement claims

- During planning, record each deliberate simplification with a material limit: why it meets current requirements, its known limit, and the evidence that would trigger revisiting it. Do not invent thresholds or weaken explicit requirements. Carry applicable limits and revisit triggers into existing durable documentation during authorized implementation or fixes. In review, verification, and audit phases, check these decisions and route gaps through the existing documentation checkpoint; do not exceed the phase's write permissions. Use existing planning and documentation sections without adding comment markers, a debt ledger, or another artifact.
- In reviews and handoffs, distinguish measured improvements from expectations. Claims of reduced latency, memory use, or cost require comparable before-and-after evidence identifying the baseline, changed version, workload, measurement method, and relevant environment. Without comparable evidence, label the expected improvement `unmeasured`; do not infer savings from fewer lines, an implementation never built, or unrelated benchmarks. Use existing verification facilities within the phase's permissions; this rule does not authorize new benchmark files, dependencies, or configuration changes.

### Types

- When adding types, use correct ones.
- Keep type declarations and annotations proportionate and readable. Do not use deeply nested, repetitive, or unnecessarily complex annotations that crowd code or obscure intent; prefer the simplest accurate type or a well-named type alias when that is clearer.
- Do not use filler types.
- Do not use overly generic types just to satisfy a checker.
- Do not use type-ignore comments to pass CI temporarily.
- Do not use `typing.Cast` or other casts merely to satisfy type checkers.

### Python

Apply this subsection only when the target repository uses Python.

The following typing coverage is a hard requirement:

- Every parameter, including `*args` and `**kwargs`, and return value of an added or changed function or method must have an explicit, accurate type hint. Treat `self` and `cls` as implicit; do not annotate them solely for this requirement.
- Every added or changed class variable, class attribute, instance attribute, and module-level mutable or optional state must have an explicit, accurate type hint. A trivial immutable module constant may remain inferred unless the configured type checker needs an annotation.
- Declare instance-attribute types at class scope where feasible; do not add `self.attribute: Type` annotations inside a method merely to satisfy this requirement.
- Do not type annotate local variables inside function or method bodies. Rely on inference; add a local annotation only to resolve a real configured type-checker error.
- Keep required annotations simple and accurate. Do not add advanced type constructs or type-only refactors unless the configured type checker requires them.

### Comments and documentation

- Document every added or changed string transformation with concrete examples showing representative input and expected output.
- Always add brief, detailed comments where they help readers understand the code with little effort.
- Comments must help readers understand the code with little effort.
- Comments must address the code itself, not be meta commentary about the task.
- Cleaning up stale comments is encouraged.
- Ensure every non-obvious change has an explanatory comment.
- Avoid bloated comment blocks. Include enough detail for junior engineers to understand easily.
- Always update related documentation.
- Find the correct docs folder by tracing GitHub Actions workflows, Makefiles, or other docs-build configuration.
- Append to the appropriate sections, or create new ones if required.
- Do not write the changelog.

### Documentation checkpoint

- Complete a documentation checkpoint at every planning, implementation, review, verification, and handoff stage.
- Before a checkpoint can pass, identify the user-, operator-, API-, configuration-, or developer-facing documentation affected by the planned or changed behavior.
- Require the exact durable documentation files/sections, their in-change-set update, and applicable docs build, link check, rendering check, or focused validation; if no durable documentation change is needed, require an evidence-based `Not applicable` decision.
- Code comments, commit messages, and workflow artifacts do not substitute for durable documentation. Do not write the changelog unless explicitly requested.

### Cross-platform behavior

- All changes must be strictly cross-platform and must work on both Linux and Windows.
- Mac is not a concern.

### Git and verification

- Commit often in small increments when committing is allowed.
- Split large commits into sensible parts.
- Add detailed commit messages.
- Explain the work in commit descriptions with as much detail as needed; no length limit.
- Do not claim work is complete without fresh verification evidence.
- Run linter and smoke test if any on every commit, unless the prompt explicitly forbids command execution.
- If a command fails, paste the exact error/log back. Never paraphrase logs.

### Tests

- Do not create, modify, or delete tests in this plan-verification phase.
- Run only focused existing tests or checks when repository evidence is needed; do not manually run the entire suite.
- Verify that the planning artifacts defer test authoring to the dedicated model-agnostic `09_write_focused_tests_any_model.md` phase.
- Do not duplicate phase `09`'s test-design, test-framework-specific, or coverage contract in this verification.

## UI work only

Enable this section only when the requested or planned work includes UI behavior, layout, presentation, or interaction. A backend service having UI consumers does not by itself enable this section. For backend-only work, skip this entire section and its skill downloads, questions, checks, and reporting.

Fetch and completely read only the applicable skills and companions explicitly linked in this section from GitHub before using them. These conditional links are exempt from unconditional skill-fetch instructions elsewhere in the prompt. If an applicable required file cannot be read completely, stop and report the blocker. Apply web-specific guidance only to web UI; do not impose CSS, React, browser, or mobile-web conventions on another UI stack.

### Conditional UI skills

- Only for eligible visual web surfaces under the frontend design gate: [design-taste-frontend](https://github.com/viseshrp/ai-skills-archive/blob/main/archives/Leonxlnx__taste-skill/snapshot/skills/taste-skill/SKILL.md).
- For web UI design decisions: [emil-design-eng](https://github.com/viseshrp/ai-skills-archive/blob/main/archives/emilkowalski__skills/snapshot/skills/emil-design-eng/SKILL.md).
- For applicable UI data and state cases: [break-ui](https://github.com/viseshrp/ai-skills-archive/blob/main/archives/emilkowalski__skills/snapshot/skills/break-ui/SKILL.md) and its required [CATALOG.md](https://github.com/viseshrp/ai-skills-archive/blob/main/archives/emilkowalski__skills/snapshot/skills/break-ui/CATALOG.md). Use the analysis and catalog only, subject to the limits below.
- When mobile-web behavior is in scope: [mobile-native](https://github.com/viseshrp/ai-skills-archive/blob/main/archives/emilkowalski__skills/snapshot/skills/mobile-native/SKILL.md). Use it for planning or review only in phases that prohibit implementation.

### Frontend design gate

Apply `design-taste-frontend` only to landing or marketing pages, portfolios, editorial or brand pages, and explicitly approved visual redesigns of those surfaces. Exclude backend-only work, dashboards, admin or dense product interfaces, data tables, multi-step forms, native mobile UI, and general refactors. For mixed work, apply it only to the eligible surface; other UI skills keep their own activation rules.

The user request, locked planning artifacts, existing brand and design system, repository conventions, accessibility, SEO, analytics, and approved dependencies override every skill default. The skill cannot authorize new dependencies, framework or design-system changes, generated assets, added motion or color modes, route or slug changes, primary-navigation or form-field changes, analytics-event changes, content or information-architecture rewrites, or architecture or scope expansion.

Treat its dials, font and palette bans, layout recipes, and content or motion preferences as suggestions unless the approved contract requires them. Use only relevant objective preflight checks. A preference alone is not a blocking or non-blocking defect that requires a fix.

Do not activate `gpt-taste`. Specialized sibling skills such as `image-to-code`, `brandkit`, or `redesign-existing-projects` require explicit task-specific authorization and their own archive links; do not load them through this skill.

For ineligible UI work, skip this skill's download and procedures and record `Frontend design: Not applicable` in the existing artifact or chat. Backend-only work skips this entire UI section, including that reporting.

### UI skill limits

- Preserve the approved scope, existing design system, component conventions, platform support, and dependency-approval rules. These skills do not authorize new UI features, animations, dependencies, framework changes, or redesigns.
- Ignore skill greeting and pause routines. Do not invoke unlisted skills or create prototype pages, development toggles, separate plans or reports, or retained fixtures through `break-ui`. Test-local fixtures may be authored only in phase `09` under its test contract. All other writes remain subject to this phase's permissions and named outputs.
- Treat recipe values and aesthetic preferences as defaults, not automatic defects. Existing tokens and approved behavior take precedence. Verify version-sensitive APIs and performance claims against the target stack's documentation and evidence. Resolve material conflicts before changing behavior; do not enforce blanket duration, easing, pure-fade, or keyboard-animation bans from a skill.
- Distinguish observed UI behavior, conclusions inferred from code, and checks awaiting a browser or real device. Use available running UI and existing tooling within the phase's permissions; do not claim visual or device verification from static inspection. Record an unavailable required check as pending or blocked in the existing artifact or chat handoff, not as passed. Do not add a new artifact or override `no-ai-slop` and its evaluator.

### Phase requirements

- For an eligible surface, verify the revised `Frontend Design Contract`, its approved scope, and its enforcement in the actual `EXECUTION_PROMPT.md`, including the complete frontend design gate, protected behavior, approved dependencies, and rendered-verification steps. Missing or weaker requirements block implementation and return to `02`; do not invent new taste requirements.
- Verify each prior UI concern against the revised plan and actual `EXECUTION_PROMPT.md`, including conditional activation, acceptance criteria, skill/companion links, write limits, documentation impact, and browser or device verification steps.
- Record evidence in `PLAN_REVISION_VERIFICATION.md`. Unresolved requirements or missing decisions return to `02`; do not write an alternate prompt, redesign the UI, or implement fixes.

## Prompt

Goal:

- determine whether Opus addressed the previous plan critique and whether the planning artifacts are ready for implementation.

Success criteria:

- each prior concern is checked against the revised artifacts and linked to concrete evidence,
- the verdict is explicit about both readiness and remaining gaps,
- every implementation step in the revised plan and execution prompt has a documentation checkpoint with an update-and-validation action or an evidence-based `Not applicable` decision,
- the output follows the exact structure below.

Constraints:

- do not implement code,
- do not modify files unless explicitly asked,
- if evidence is missing, say so explicitly instead of guessing.

Context to review:

- the previous `PLAN_CRITIQUE.md`,
- the previous `OPUS_PLAN_REVISION_REQUEST.md`, if present,
- `PLAN_REVISION_SUMMARY.md`,
- the updated `FEATURE_SPEC_AND_PLAN.md`,
- the updated `EXECUTION_PROMPT.md`,
- original draft plan/interviewing notes if available.

Working method:

- inspect the revised artifacts and any needed repository files before finalizing; inspect independent files in parallel when your available tools make that efficient,
- stay grounded in the supplied artifacts and any repository context you inspect,
- quote or clearly point to where each concern was addressed,
- check the actual `EXECUTION_PROMPT.md` against every applicable implementation requirement in the Engineering Contract, including its priority, scope, conditions, exceptions, and stop gates; report omissions or weaker instructions as blocking issues and do not mark it ready for implementation,
- distinguish resolved issues, partial fixes, missing fixes, and invalid original concerns,
- verify that every implementation step still maps to exact durable documentation and validation, or to an evidence-based `Not applicable` decision,
- if the revision introduced a new problem, call it out explicitly instead of forcing a pass verdict.

Task:

- determine whether the revised plan and revised execution prompt satisfy all previously raised concerns,
- produce `PLAN_REVISION_VERIFICATION.md`,
- if anything remains unresolved, do not author a new revision prompt here; instead make it explicit that the workflow must return to the critique phase so `02_plan_critique_any_model.md` can produce the next `OPUS_PLAN_REVISION_REQUEST.md`.

Artifact location rule:

- all workflow-generated Markdown artifacts for this workflow must live in the target repo root using the exact required filenames,
- do not normalize them into subdirectories or alternate paths,
- all workflow-generated Markdown artifacts must include `Created by`, `Created at`, and `Updated at` metadata, preserving creation fields and refreshing `Updated at` on edits,
- treat any artifact-path drift as a workflow failure to call out explicitly.

For each previously raised concern:

- quote or summarize the concern,
- identify where it was addressed,
- classify status as `Resolved`, `Partially Resolved`, `Not Resolved`, or `Invalid Concern`,
- explain your reasoning.

## Required output: `PLAN_REVISION_VERIFICATION.md`

Create `PLAN_REVISION_VERIFICATION.md` in the target repo root.

Use this structure:

```markdown
# Plan Revision Verification

## Verdict
- All previous concerns resolved: Yes/No
- Documentation checkpoints complete: Yes/No
- Ready for implementation: Yes/No

## Concern-by-Concern Verification

| Concern | Status | Evidence | Remaining Action |
|---|---|---|---|

## Documentation Checkpoint Verification

## Remaining Blocking Issues

## Remaining Non-Blocking Issues

## New Issues Introduced By Revision

## Required Next Action
```

If any issue remains:

- do not create `OPUS_PLAN_REVISION_REQUEST.md` in this phase,
- state explicitly that the workflow must return to `02_plan_critique_any_model.md`,
- state that `02` is the only phase that should author `OPUS_PLAN_REVISION_REQUEST.md`,
- if `OPUS_PLAN_REVISION_REQUEST.md` was missing, weak, or failed to retain needed revision instructions, report the upstream critique/request failure; do not compensate here.

If no issue remains and every documentation checkpoint is complete, state clearly that the plan is ready for implementation.
